✨ Biometric Attendance System Using ESP32 with Fingerprint Sensor ✨
A biometric attendance system utilizing an ESP32 and a fingerprint sensor offers a secure and efficient way to track attendance. Here's an overview:

📌 Key Features
🔒 Fingerprint Sensor: Captures and stores fingerprint templates for accurate identification (e.g., R305 or GT-521F).
⚙️ ESP32 Microcontroller: Acts as the brain of the system, handling fingerprint recognition, data processing, and communication.
🌐 Local Server: Stores attendance logs and user information, accessible over a Wi-Fi network via HTTP or MQTT.
🖥️ Web Interface: Provides an easy-to-use platform for managing users and viewing attendance data.
📊 Real-Time Logging: Ensures attendance is recorded and updated immediately on the server.
🚀 Workflow
👤 Enrollment: Users register their fingerprints, which are stored for future verification.
✅ Verification: The system matches scanned fingerprints against stored templates.
📥 Attendance Logging: Successful matches log attendance and send records to the server.
📂 Data Access: Admins can view logs and manage records via the web interface.
