The connections are pretty simple. Connect the VCC and GND pins of FR307, OLED display, and RTC module to the 3.3V pin and GND pins respectively. Then connect the SDA and SCL pins of the RTC module and the OLED display to the GPIO21 and GPIO22 respectively. Now connect the TX pin from the FR307 to GPIO16 and the RX pin to the GPIO17.
